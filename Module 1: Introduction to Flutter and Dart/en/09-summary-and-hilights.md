# Summary and Highlights: Introduction to Flutter and Dart

## Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:

- Flutter is a framework for building cross-platform mobile apps for iOS, Android, and the web.

- Developers use Flutter because it has comprehensive tools and features, flexible widget and UI customization, and near-native performance.

- The benefits of Flutter include a single codebase, hot reload, expressive UIs, and high performance.

- The main components of Flutter development include the Flutter software development kit (SDK), the Dart programming language, integrated development environments (IDEs), and emulators and physical devices.

- Flutter applications are written in Dart, an open-source programming language that is optimized for UI development.

- The main steps for building an app in Flutter include project setup, using Dart for logic, managing states in the app, and testing the app on emulators and physical devices.

- The four common mobile development frameworks for iOS and Android are Flutter, React Native, Xamarin, and native development.

- These frameworks include some key factors, including performance, development speed, code reusability, UI and customization, and community and ecosystem.

- The Flutter toolchain is a collection of tools and libraries that help streamline the development, testing, and deployment of Flutter applications.

- The Flutter engine is the runtime environment that ensures the Flutter apps perform smoothly and look visually appealing on various devices.

- The key Flutter utilities are Flutter DevTools for performance and debugging tools, Flutter Inspector for inspecting UI layouts, Data Analyzer for checking Dart code, Flutter Doctor for checking the environment and configuration, and Hot Reload for viewing the results of code changes.

- Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps, and its fundamentals include variables, data types, and functions.

- Dart supports various data types, including int, double, String, bool, and List.
