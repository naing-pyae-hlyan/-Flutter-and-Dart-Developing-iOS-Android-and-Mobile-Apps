## Summary and Highlights: Exploring Dart Language
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:

1. Dart VM runs code using just-in-time (JIT) compilation that translates code while the machine is running and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation that translates codes before the program is running.

2. Common data types for variables include numbers, strings, Booleans, lists, and maps.

3. The two types of numbers in Dart are int for integers and double for floating-point numbers.

4. Functions in Dart are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

5. Methods are functions that are associated with an object, such as the list class, which provides methods to interact with list data.

6. Public properties allow access to your object, while private properties protect sensitive information.****

7. Getters perform calculations or formatting, and setters validate input or trigger actions.

8. Static methods are used for utility functions, anonymous functions are used for short operations, encapsulation protects an object's data from unauthorized access, and inheritance helps organize complex code.

9. The dart:core library handles basic data types, collections, and utility functions.

10. The dart:async library handles tasks that involve delays, such as network requests or file I/O.

11. Creating your library boosts project maintainability and modularity.

12. Dart SDK is a collection of tools and libraries for developing Dart applications.

13. The dart command is a versatile tool for running Dart programs, managing packages, and performing various development tasks.
