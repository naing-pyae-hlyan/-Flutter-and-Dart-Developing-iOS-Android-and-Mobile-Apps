1. Welcome to this video on the Command Line and Utilities. After watching this video, you'll be able to describe various command line tools, including dart SDK, dart command, pub tool, and dart dev tools. In addition, you will learn how to increase your productivity by using third party tools such as shell scripting, make files, and continuous integration CI with Flutter and Dart. Imagine you are working on a dart project, and need to automate tasks, run tests, and manage dependencies efficiently. To do so, you can leverage the command line and various utilities available in Dart. These utilities are essential for effective dart development and help you streamline your scripting, testing, and dependency management workflow. Let's learn about common command line tools in Dart. 


2. Dart provides several command line tools for creating, running, testing, and analyzing Dart projects. These tools are Dart SDK, Dart Command, Pub Tool, and Dart Dev Tools. The Dart Software Development Kit SDK is a collection of tools and libraries for developing dart applications. It includes the Dart VM, the Core libraries, and Command Line tools. To start using Dart, you need to install the Dart SDK. You can download and install the Dart SDK from the official Dart website. For installation, follow the instructions for your specific operating system, such as Windows, MacOS, or Linux. 


3. Another utility, the Dart command is a versatile tool for running dart programs, managing packages, and performing various development tasks. Here are common Dart commands. Let's understand the use of some common commands and detail with examples. You can use the Dart Run command to execute Dart scripts. For example, the displayed command will compile and run the MyScript.dart file. The Dart Analyze command helps you check your code for errors, warnings, and potential issues. It is a valuable tool for maintaining code quality. 


4. For example, here is the output that gets displayed when running the Dart analyzed V command. You can run your Dart test using the Dart test command. This helps ensure your code works as expected. For example, running the Dart test reporter expanded command will display the given output. The Dart format command automatically formats your Dart code according to the standard Dart style guide. For example, here is the output that gets displayed when running the Dart format command. The Dart create command helps you generate new dart projects with a standard structure. 


5. For example, running the Dart create my_project command will display the given output. Let's understand another utility available in Dart called Pub Tool. The Pub Tool is Dart's package manager. It helps you manage dependencies and publish packages. Let's look at some common pub commands. You can add new dependencies to your project using the Pub Add command. For example, running the Dart pub at HTTP command adds the HTTP package to your projects do YAML file, and fetches its details. 


6. Here is a sample output of executing this command. The pub get command installs all the dependencies listed in your pubspec.yaml file. For example, running the dart pub get command will display this output. The pub upgrade command can update the dependencies to the latest compatible versions. For example, running the dart pub upgrade command will display this output. Finally, you can publish your packages to the dart repository using the publish command. For example, here is the output that gets displayed when executing the dart pub publish command. 


7. The next utility, essential for effective development of dart applications is dart dev tools. It is a suite of performance and debugging tools for dart and flutter applications. It provides a web based interface to help you analyze and optimize your code. Let's look at some features of Dart DevTools. One of the key features of Dart DevTools is performance profiling. You can monitor application performance in real time, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing your code for better performance. Dart DevTools provides detailed insights into CPU and memory usage, helping you pinpoint areas that need improvement. 


8. Here is an example displaying the performance profiling feature. Another important feature is memory analysis. Dart DevTools allows you to inspect memory usage, helping you detect memory leaks and optimize memory consumption. You can track allocations, analyze memory graphs, and take snapshots to compare memory states over a period. Let's look at this example, which displays the memory analysis feature of Dart DevTools. Finally, the widget Inspector feature of DevTools for Flutter applications provides a visual representation of the Widget tree. This representation helps simplify understanding and debugging your UI. 


9. Here's an example of Widget Inspector. You can select widgets in the visual tree to view their properties and layout constraints. In addition to the key command line utilities available in Dart, various third party tools work with flutter and Dart to enhance productivity. Some of these tools are shell scripting, make files, and CI. Let's look at how you can use these tools with dart. Shell scripting is a tool that can enhance your productivity by automating repetitive tasks. You can write shell scripts to automate the setup of your development environment, run tests, or deploy your application. 


10. Here is an example of a shell script that automates the running of dart tests. Make files are another powerful tool for automating tasks. They allow you to define rules for building and managing your project. Here is an example of a simple make file for a Dart project. By incorporating continuous integration or CI into your development workflow, you can ensure that your code is always in a deployable state. Some examples of common CI tools that support dart include GitHub actions, Travis CI, and Circle CI. To conclude, command line tools and utilities are crucial for efficient and effective dart development. 


11. Whether you are creating scripts, running tests, or managing dependencies mastering these tools allows you to streamline the development workflow, maintain high code quality, and build robust applications. In this video, you learned that Dart provides several essential command line tools for managing and running dart applications. The Dart SDK is a collection of tools and libraries for developing dart applications. You need to install it to start using Dart. The Dart Command is a versatile tool for running Dart programs, managing packages, and performing various development tasks. The Pub tool is Dart's package manager, which helps you manage dependencies and publish packages. Dart DevTools is a suite of performance and debugging tools for Dart and Flutter applications. 


12. Other third party tools that work well with Dart to enhance productivity include shell scripting, make files, and CI. Now that you have learned the basic common tools for Dart application development, you will dive deeper into advanced Dart features and best practices in the next videos.
