## Summary and Highlights: Working with Flutter

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:

1. Flutter allows you to build apps for both Android and iOS from a single codebase, streamlining development and reducing costs.

2. Flutter offers robust solutions for managing dynamic data and keeping apps responsive and efficient.

3. Stateless widgets are immutable and constant, while Stateful widgets can manage and update their state over time.

4. Flutter offers a wide variety of widgets, including basic, layout, input, button, and list widgets, each serving specific functions to build a responsive UI.

5. User interaction is enabled using the TextField widget, which is the basic widget for creating text input.

6. Forms are made with multiple TextField widgets combined within a Form widget, and gesture detectors handle interactions such as swipes, taps, and long presses.

7. Stack navigation in Flutter allows transitions by stacking pages or screens.

8. Tab navigations in Flutter enable users to switch between sections, and drawer navigation slides out from the side of the screen.

9. Create named routes for a centralized and structured navigation approach, and create direct routes by passing Material Page Route or Cupertino Page Route directly to the navigator.

10. Perform basic navigation by using the navigator class and transfer data between screens to enable real-time app interactions.

11. In Flutter, all app components are widgets, forming the core elements of the app.

12. Flutter offers styling through built-in and custom themes and direct widget customization.
